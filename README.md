This repository contains my Excel references and projects. 

### File descriptions

#### Excel_formulas_charts_reference
This Excel file contains detailed explanations and examples of the formulas, functions, charts, and graphs I have learned in [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io) Excel courses. Each function category is housed in a separate tab, and the charts and graphs are divided into two tabs, one for basic and one for advanced. 

#### Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_Dashboard_v2
This Excel file contains the raw data, analysis and transformation steps, and an interactive dashboard, created with Austin Animal Center's intake data from October 2013 through October 2022. The use the interactive drop-down menus, download the Excel file. Note that I did remove fields that were not used in dashboard from the raw data tab in order to make the file small enough to upload to this repository. To view the entire dataset, which is updated on a daily basis, visit the [City of Austin Open Data Portal.](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm)

#### COA_Annual_Crime_Data_2015-2018
This Excel file contains two interactive graphs showing crime trends for the City of Austin from 2015 through 2018. The first sheet, "Trends by crime type," contains a line graph showing trends by month and type of crime for each year, 2015-2018. The second sheet, "Location," is a heat map showing the distribution of crime by zip code. The darkest green color represents the lowest crime numbers, and the darkest red represents the highest crime numbers. Download the files to use the interactive drop-down menus on both sheets. 

The remaining sheets in this file contain the raw data used in the analysis and to create the graphs. Note, I did remove fields that I did not use to create the graphs from the data. The datasets were downloaded from the City of Austin Open Data Portal on November 20, 2022. See below for a link to view each original dataset.
