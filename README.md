# Excel Projects

This repository contains my Excel references and projects. 

###File descriptions

####Excel_formula_reference
This Excel file contains the formulas and functions I learned in the Maven Analytics Excel Formulas & Functions course. Each function category is housed in a separate tab. I also included an explanation of the function and its purpose, definitions for required and optional arguments, and example syntax.
