# Excel Projects

This repository contains my Excel references and projects. 

### File descriptions

#### Excel_formulas_charts_reference
This Excel file contains detailed explanations and examples of the formulas, functions, charts, and graphs I have learned in [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io) Excel courses. Each function category is housed in a separate tab, and the charts and graphs are divided into two tabs, one for basic and one for advanced. 

#### Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_Dashboard_v2
This Excel file contains the raw data, analysis and transformation steps, and an interactive dashboard created with Austin Animal Center's intake data spanning October 2013 through October 2022. The use the interactive drop-down menus, download the Excel file. Note that I did remove fields that were not used in dashboard from the raw data tab in order to make the file small enough to upload to this repository. To view the entire dataset, which is updated on a daily basis, visit the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Intakes/wter-evkm)
